**Welcome to my website!** I'm a Chilean Environmental and Natural Resource Economist.

During most of the time I'm a PhD student at the Delft University of Technology, in the Netherlands, focusing on developing my research project on Participatory Value Evaluation and their extensions.

In my free times I refill my caffeine requirements visiting some new cafeterias, bringing my camera to capture some good moments, mostly sunsets (I suck taking day pictures).

Some nights I try to improve my programming skills trying to link it with my research interests (see below). I use mostly R and Matlab, and I am learning Python at utilitary level, and more recently the Julia programming language.
